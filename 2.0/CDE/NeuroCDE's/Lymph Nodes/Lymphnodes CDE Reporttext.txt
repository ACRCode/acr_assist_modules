Updated based on information from Adam

Multiple pathologic lymph nodes are present in the left neck.
The largest node measures 17 mm in long axis.  
The involved surgical levels include:  2a, 2b, 3, 4 and 5b.  
There is no definite radiologic evidence of extracapsular spread. 
There is no evidence of central necrosis.  
The enhancement pattern is predominantly solid.  
These nodes are in the expected drainage pattern of the primary tumor.  
There is probable invasion of the prevertebral space.
