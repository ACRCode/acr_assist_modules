updated based on the information from Adam
A focal mass is present at the Left aspect of the pituitary.  
Maximum dimension is 3 mm.  
The lesion borders are well defined.  
Without contrast, relative to the normal pituitary, the lesion is T1 isointense.  
Following infusion of contrast, the lesion relative to the normal pituitary is Hypoenhancing.  
The infundibulum is Midline and size is Normal.  
The infundibulum enhances.   
The posterior neurohypophysis bright spot is present. 
Confidence in diagnosis is confidence:1-very confident.
