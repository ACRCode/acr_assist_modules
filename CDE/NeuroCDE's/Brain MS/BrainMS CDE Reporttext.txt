updated based on Adam's information 
Supratentorially, there are  11  T2/FLAIR hyperintensites in the cerebral white matter including both frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. 
These lesions are primarily juxtacortical and periventricular. 
Infratentorially, there are four T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the brainstem including the left pons, left brachium pontis and right cerebellum. 
Additional lesions are   visualized in the upper cervical spinal cord. 
There is no associated mass effect. 
There are black holes present in the parietal white matter.
